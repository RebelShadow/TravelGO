TravelGo is a comprehensive travel companion designed to enhance users' 
dining experiences by providing a platform for them to share restaurant reviews and 
add establishments to their personal wishlists. In addition to browsing and 
contributing reviews, registered users have the ability to save restaurants to their 
wishlists for future reference. To maintain an up-to-date database, TravelGo's 
administrators are responsible for adding new restaurants to the platform.
